# blip
Blip is a lightweight, visually-semantic css framework built in less

## why is this a thing?
I've spent many years trying to manage extreme amounts of custom css in enterprise situations and become incredibly frustrated with trying to not only **maintain** an incredibly complex cascade, but also **teach** others how the thing actually works, and it's completely unsustainable. I was just so sick of writing new css, and then I read an article that really resonated with me:

It was like a bolt of lightning hitting me right between the eyes and led me to read a lot of things by [mrmrs](https://twitter.com/mrmrs_) which led me to a project he created: [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io). After getting myself past the years of scar-tissue of writing complex, external cascade and embracing this _lego block_ style of styling, I truly believe it is one of the most important, transformative patterns to come to the web in many years.

I created **blip** as an academic exercise, mainly because I'm a software developer and we always want to reinvent the wheel, but also to give me a greater understanding the pattern and of styling in general. 

**I like to see this as a tribute to one of the most transformative and positive styling patterns on the web**

## how to use
Pretty simply grab _blip.min.css_ from the _bin_ folder (autoprefixed and minified) and plop it into a style tag, then you get everything.

If you want to compile, clone the repo; npm install and off you go.
