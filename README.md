# blip
Blip is a lightweight, visually-semantic css framework built in less

## why is this a thing?
I've spent many years trying to manage extreme amounts of custom css in enterprise situations and become incredibly frustrated with trying to not only **maintain** an incredibly complex cascade, but also **teach** others how the thing actually works, and it's completely unsustainable. So, I created something very simple quite a while ago for rapid prototyping and for academic reasons. 

I'm just sick of writing new css. This really resonates with me:

## why not just [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) or [AtomicCSS](https://acss.io/)...
... or practically any other framework that is vastly better than this?

I love the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) patterns, so, being a developer and nerd, I typically wanted to try and make something like that myself, and that's how blip came about. I think people should definitely use it for their styling projects.

## so, this project is meaningless?
Yes, and no - from an academic perspective, it was really interesting to really dive deeply into styling; but I would certainly always use a more maintained and robust, responsive framework (as described earlier) for their styling requirements. 

**I like to see this as a tribute to one of the most transformative and positive styling patterns on the web that I can remember**
