    Mixins to build a basic grid layout.

    Builds a grid up to 5 distinct cells with the provided gutter.
    This will probably become redundant when CSS grid implementation becomes more widespread.

    .col-[count]:       Column based on size of count with horizontal gutter
    .row-[count]:       Row based on size of count with vertical gutter
